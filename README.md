# AlpacaStock
Usually during the day I'm too busy or just forget to check on the stocks I either own or are interested in.

I saw Alpaca(https://alpaca.markets/) with their API and was interested in using it, just for fun and to learn a little bit
more about working with APIs.

So currently this project will just be informational, no trading through this just yet.

The idea is that when a price changes either higher or lower, this will send a message to me that I might want to look at
some stocks.
